# Exam-Invigilation-Planner
A Java-based desktop application that automates the assignment of teachers to exam invigilation duties using a conflict-free backtracking algorithm. Built with Java Swing, the application allows users to add exams, manage teacher availability, and generate optimized schedules with a modern dark-themed UI. 
📘 Exam Invigilation Planner – Java Desktop App
Welcome to the Exam Invigilation Planner – a smart Java-based desktop application designed to automate and simplify the process of assigning teachers to exams. This project was built as part of a 6-week summer training to apply core concepts of logic building, Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA), and Java GUI development in a real-world educational scenario.

🧠 What It Does
Manually creating an invigilation schedule can be time-consuming and error-prone. This tool helps educational institutions automate the task by:

Taking input of exams and their time slots

Allowing entry of teachers and their unavailable slots

Using a backtracking algorithm to assign teachers in a way that avoids conflicts (like double booking or unavailable slots)

Generating a readable schedule output

Saving and loading past schedules (CSV format)

Providing printing and history features

All wrapped in a clean, dark-themed Java Swing GUI!

🎯 Key Features
✅ Add exams and teachers with time constraints
✅ Conflict-free scheduling using backtracking
✅ History management (save/load to CSV)
✅ Print the generated schedule directly
✅ Stylish and intuitive dark-themed UI
✅ User-friendly alerts, buttons, and validations

🛠️ Tech Stack
Language: Java

GUI Framework: Java Swing

Algorithm: Backtracking (for scheduling)

Data Storage: CSV file handling

Concepts Applied: OOP, DSA, File I/O, Exception Handling, Event-Driven Programming

🎓 What I Learned
During the development of this project, I got hands-on experience with:

Designing modular and reusable code using Object-Oriented Programming

Writing and debugging recursive logic for constraint-based problems

Handling real-time user input and validations in GUI

Managing data persistence through file operations

Building polished interfaces with attention to UX

It was a great way to apply what I learned in my summer training on DSA and logic building, and turn theory into a working solution.
